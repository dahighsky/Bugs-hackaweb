## Abstract

### Problem Statement
Getting a proper health facility is a dream for all. Not all government hospitals have good facilities, equipment, or experienced staff to take care of the people of that city. This issue can be resolved if all the government hospitals work collaboratively and ensure good facilities are provided to all.

### Use Case
Consider in a small town, a government hospital does not have the equipment to treat the patient. So, the hospital referred that patient to a more equipped government hospital near to the city. Now the patient feels helpless to go to the referred government hospital and explain his/her illness, as they now must follow the same procedure as followed before in the small-town government hospital to get information about the illness like going through the same tests, same checkups, etc.

### Objectives
We have to create a prototype that solves the issues mentioned above. 
Features:  
  • Patients' records must be maintained on the platform, sharing while referring to other government hospitals. <br>
  • The government hospitals must have a way to connect with other government hospitals. <br>
  • Referring patients to other government hospitals must be made seamless.<br>
  
 ### Tech Stacks
  • HTML
  • CSS
  • Javascript
  • Firebase
  
### Access
  • To access different Hospital Profiles use h1/h2/h3/h4 as the log in IDs for different profiles
  • Password for each profile is "123"
  • Just for the deployment build the LogIn credentials are available otherwise they are stored securely.
